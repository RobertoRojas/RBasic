# RBasic

This language was crafted for a university course titled 'Compilers and Interpreters'. It is strictly an academic exercise, so I strongly advise against using it in real-world projects.

The primary concept behind this language is flexibility. By merely adjusting the values in a [dictionary](RBasic\src\diccionario\TPReservada.java), you can alter its reserved words. This way, you can essentially craft a 'new' language without having to reprogram the entire functionality.

The language employs blocks to delineate variable scopes and their respective values. It also utilizes the arithmetic system referred to as [Calculadora_expresiones_aritmeticas](https://github.com/RobertoRojas/Calculadora_expresiones_aritmeticas).
